# Interacting with the Bot

At the moment, the bot doesn't take any feedback. However the `alive` and the `tracked` [commands](/Badger/commands) can be used to obtain useful information from the bot. 
 
The `tracked` command returns the list of the tracked badges in the current room. For example

    63 : Tumbleweed
    51 : Python
    3557 : maven
    4 : Cleanup
    262 : publicist

The `commands` command can be used to retrieve the list of commands.
