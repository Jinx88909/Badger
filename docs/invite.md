# Inviting badger to your room

To invite the bot into your room, ping any of the room owners of SOBotics. However the following are to be noted. 

1. Atleast one other room owner must agree to the bot being in your room. 
2. The maximum number of badges that can be tracked is 1000, hence the number of badges to be tracked at the moment is restricted to 100. 
3. If the bot runs rogue, (which it will not), inform the room owners of SOBotics before taking any other action.
